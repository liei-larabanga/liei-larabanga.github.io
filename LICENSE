TurboSidebar is an adaptation from leaflet-sidebar (v2) - https://github.com/Turbo87/sidebar-v2
CSS has been only modified to harmonize style with Mapbox GL map controls.
JS has been significantly modified removing any Leaflet dependency avoiding
adding Mapbox GL dependency. However, there is a JQuery depencency that could be
removed in the future.
